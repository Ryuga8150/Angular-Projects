  <!-- with custom structural directive -->

  <!-- 1. Add ng-template: default it will not show any markup placed inside it
  it is used to prepare some markup
  whenever you add some * behind the scenes this wrapper gets added 
  the class sould be attached to ng-template -->

  <!-- <ng-template appAuth="admin">
    <p>Only admins should see this!!!</p>
  </ng-template> -->

  <!-- 2. will be in the directive file adding templateRef and viewContainerRef -->

  <!-- now will use * in front of the directive which acts as a syntactic sugar -->
  <!-- not the contents between "" will be taken as ts code so you will have to place '' for string values -->
